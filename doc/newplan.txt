Use the rockstar halo catalogs from many conseulo boxes.
For study #1, which ignores M33, we could also use esmerelda boxes if we need more volume.


1.  Mass of M_MW, M_31, M_LG, checking timing argument, proper motion of M31

  Prior sampling:

    -- Find all Local Group analogs (LGAs), defined by:
       -- isolation from more massive objects
       -- 2 central halos with appropriate separation (pairs)
       -- 1 massive subhalo close to one of the central halos (triplets)
       
       See notes-mtb.txt for details!
       
    -- Write out 3 output files, one for each object, that contain:
         ID_MW ID_M31 ID_M33 M200 x y z vx vy vz
       
       MW_halos_JJ.txt
       M31_halos_JJ.txt
       M33_halos_JJ.txt (much smaller)
       
       -- ID is ROCKSTAR ID, and all files have all halo IDs in them. For
       systems that have MW and M31 but no M33, set ID_M33 to -1
       -- coordinate system is cosmic consuelo, with comoving distances
       -- JJ is the consuelo run number (00 to 39)

  Importance weighting:

    -- weight MW-M31 separation by distance to M31:
       774 +/- 40 kpc (VdM+G 2008) USE THIS
        [744 +/- 33 kpc (Vilardell 2010)]
        [785 +/- 25 (McConnachie et al 2005)]
    -- weight radial_velocity by radial velocity M31:
       -130 +/- 8 km/s (Van der Marel & Guhathakurtha 2008)
    -- weight log10 M1 by M_MW from Busha et al paper:
       12.2 +/- 0.1

  DONE first attempt, looked at masses, sum and ratio. 
  Constraint on M2 (M31) is weakish, M_LG to 0.3 dex. Need
  more constraints probably, eg from M33 proper motion.

    -- weight MW-M33 separation by distance to M33: 
  
  TO DO:

  a) Check: independence of constraints. V independent of r?

    No - but its only weakly dependent. 
    VdM+G08 take the observed line of sight systemic velocity and subtract off
    the Sun's velocity - to do this projection they need the distance to M31, I
    think. I'll try and figure out the covariance so we can include it with the
    distance error. PJM!

  b) Include M31 vtan constraint? Also not independent...

    The proper motion of M31 is what VdM+G are all about - and they do it by
    looking at the satellite kinematics around the system. I think we should
    rather look to use the M33 proper motion to constrain M31 (like they did),
    but with a cosmological prior rather than assuming M33 is bound to M31 and in
    a Gaussian velocity distribution centred on M31's.
    DONE: we infer this, not assume it.

  c) Comparing with Timing Argument masses:
  
    Compute M_TA, the timing argument mass of the local group, and compare
    with M1+M2. Note that in this context M_TA is merely a function of the
    model parameters: we have replaced M_TA as an LG mass estimate, but can
    check its bias in our model. 
    How does M_TA vary with M1+M2? For which halos is M_TA accurate?
  
  d) Individual masses of M31 and M33. What is the probability that M31 is
     more massive than MW? 
  
  e) Predict proper motion of M31: translate M31 v into sky coords. What is
     the predicted angular speed in arcsec per year? And in which direction?!

Paper II. Halo shapes of MW and M31, angular momenta of halos
          compared to stellar disks, masses of LG galaxies.

  Prior sampling, including M33 analogs:
   
    -- Take pairs from above.
    -- Define M33 isolation distance, D_iso^M33 = 2Mpc, from the MW halo.
    -- Keep sample if there is <= 3 halos within D_iso^M33
    -- Define M31 radius, R^M31 = 450kpc from the M31 halo.
    -- Define MW radius, R^MW = 300kpc from the MW halo.
    -- Keep sample if:
       -- There is exactly 1 halo within R^M31 and it is closer to M31 than
          MW. Let this halo be M33.
       -- Any additional halos (of which there at most 2) are within R^MW and
          are closer to MW than M31
    -- Write out sample.
    
    -- Write out 1 output file for the M33 object, that contains:
         ID ID_M31 M200 x y z vx vy vz Lx Ly Lz Cxx Cxy Cxz Cyx Cyy Cyz Czx Czy Czz

       M33_halos_JJ.txt
       
       -- ID_M31 is the ROCKSTAR ID of the M31 halo that this M33 lives in.
          This is to allow cross-matching of the catalogs
       -- JJ is the consuelo run number (00 to 39)
     
   Importance weighting:  
     
     -- Weight as above with M31 properties

    -- weight by distance to M33
     799+/-23 kpc
     
    -- weight by angle between M31 and M33
     14.8 deg, with artifical scatter...Might need wiggle room here.
    
    -- weight by radial velocity to M33
     190 +/- 59 km/s relative to MW (Brunthaler)
    
    -- weight by proper motion of M33
     TB Worked out [PJM] relative to MW
          


Analysis:

    -- Read in to python and compute extra quantities, like separation1_2 separation2_3 separation1_3 radial_velocity1_2 radial_velocity2_3 radial_velocity1_3
         angle1_2 angle2_3 angle1_3

    -- weight by the things above (ie distance to M31, relative v, mass of MW)
    

*** look at the following properties with the weights above

-- M_MW
-- M_31

-- M_MW/M_31

-- M_MW+M_31
-- comment on timing argument mass

-- v_tan(M31) - predict proper motion
-- orbit parameters for halos: collision times from future pericenter passage?

-- is the environment of these systems different from the environment of
systems of M_MW?

-- is the formation history of these systems different from the environment of
systems of M_MW?

-- is M33 bound?
-- when did it arrive? in LG? in M31?
-- M_33
-- M_MW+M_31+M33


New paper?

-- M31 and MW halo shapes: can we detect extension in any direction?

-- predictions of overdensity on sky? For indirect detection? Satellite
density?

-- dark matter overdensity in a certain direction
stack on the line of sight to M31.
look that direction and the opposite direction.
