Studying the Local Group with Consuelo
--------------------------------------

Use the rockstar halo catalogs from many Conseulo boxes.

Prior sampling:

    -- Find all central halos: each one is an MW candidate.
    -- Define M31 isolation distance, D_iso^M31 = 3Mpc, from this halo.
    -- Keep sample if there is <= 1 halo with M > M_MW within D_iso^M31
    -- Let M31 be the most massive halo within D_iso^M31 from MW
    -- Write out sample if D_M31 = [574,974] (eg 774 +/- 5sigma)
    
    Now include M33 analogs:
   
    -- Take pairs from above.
    -- Define M33 isolation distance, D_iso^M33 = 2Mpc, from the MW halo.
    -- Keep sample if there is <= 3 halos within D_iso^M33
    -- Define M31 radius, R^M31 = 450kpc from the M31 halo.
    -- Define MW radius, R^MW = 300kpc from the MW halo.
    -- Keep sample if:
       -- There is exactly 1 halo within R^M31 and it is closer to M31 than
          MW. Let this halo be M33.
       -- Any additional halos (of which there at most 2) are within R^MW and
          are closer to MW than M31
    -- Write out sample.
    
    Sample files:
    
    -- Write out 3 output files, one for each object, that contain:
         ID_MW ID_M31 ID_M33 M200 x y z vx vy vz Lx Ly Lz Cxx Cxy Cxz Cyx Cyy Cyz Czx Czy Czz
       
       MW_halos_JJ.txt
       M31_halos_JJ.txt
       M33_halos_JJ.txt (much smaller)
       
    -- ID is ROCKSTAR ID, and all files have all halo IDs in them. For
       systems that have MW and M31 but no M33, set ID_M33 to -1
    -- NB. N_pairs >> N_triplets
    -- coordinate system is cosmic consuelo
    -- JJ is the consuelo run number (00 to 39)

Paper I.  The Dark Mass and Dynamics of the Local Group

Questions:

  What is the mass of the Local Group? How precisely do the kinematics of M31
  constrain it?
  
  How much difference does having an M33 make? How precisely to its kinematics
  constrain the mass of M31?

  How is (M1+M2) different from the Timing Argument mass? What is A200?
  For which types of halos would M_TA be an accurate estimator? 

  What are the masses of the MW, M31 and M33 halos, individually? 
  How do these estimates compare with previous measurements? 
  Is M31 more massive than the MW? 


For discussion:

  Interpretation of A200 result.
  
  Tension in MW halo mass estimate?

  [What are the predicted numbers of subhalos more massive than X for MW and M31?]
  [Ratios of predicted numbers of satellites at some mass scale?]
    (Choose X based on MBK claims of massive Fornax problem).
  
  
  
  
Importance weighting:
NEED TO UPDATE TO VdM++2012

    -- weight by distance to M31:
        D = 774 +/- 40 kpc (Van der Marel & Guhathakurtha 2008) USE THIS
        [744 +/- 33 kpc (Vilardell 2010)]
        [785 +/- 25 (McConnachie et al 2005)]
    -- weight by Galactocentric tangential and radial velocity of M31:
        Vr = -130 +/- 8 km/s (VG08)
        Vt = xx +/- xx km/s (VG08)
    -- weight by log10 M_MW from Busha et al paper:
        M200_MW = 12.2 +/- 0.1

  DONE first attempt, looked at masses, sum and ratio. 
  Constraint on M2 (M31) is weakish, M_LG to 0.3 dex. Need
  more constraints probably, eg from M31 and M33 proper motion.
  
    -- weight by distance to M33:
       799 +/- 23 kpc (VG08) USE THIS
    -- weight by radial velocity of M33:
       -190 +/- 59 km/s (Brunthaler, check, cf VG08)
    -- weight by tangential velocity of M33:
       xxx +/- xx km/s (VG08, approximately)
 
    -- weight by angle between M31 and M33
       14.8 deg, with artifical scatter... Might need wiggle room here.
  

TO DO:

  * Compute vr, vt, d for MW and M33 relative to M31. Vectors. Direction of
     M33 motion? How to propagate errors? Monte Carlo... Constraints
     from VdM12 and VG08, and citations therein.
     Check: independence of constraints. vr, vt independent of r?

     Notes: VG08 take the observed line of
     sight systemic velocity and subtract off the Sun's velocity - to do this
     projection they need the distance to M31 - but this is a small 
     covariance [citation needed]. More of an issue will be transforming to
     M33's motion relative to M31... VdM++12 have done some of this.
          
     TODO: PJM

  * The mass of the Local Group from the kinematics of M31: comparing with the
    Timing Argument:
  
     PDF for M_LG = M_MW + M_M31, given M31 kinematics. Precision on M_LG,
     comparison with literature.
     
     Compute M_TA, the timing argument mass of the local group, and compare
     with M_MW+M_M31. Note that in this context M_TA is merely a function of the
     model parameters: we have replaced M_TA as an LG mass estimate, but can
     check its bias in our model. What is A200? 
     How does M_TA vary with M_LG? For which halos is M_TA accurate?
     
     TODO: PJM
  
  * The mass of M31, from the kinematics of M33:
  
     PDF for M_M31, given M33 kinematics. Precision, comparison with
     literature.
     
     Compute M_TA, the timing argument mass of this pair, and compare
     with M_M31+M_M33. How accurate is M_TA in this situation? 
     
     TODO: PJM
  
  * Individual masses of M31, M33 and MW, given combination of kinematic
    constraints.
     
     PDF for M_MW, given M31 and M33 kinematics.
     What is the probability that M31 is more massive than MW? 
     Is the MW mass consistent with other estimates?
     
     TODO: PJM

Paper II. The Shape and Angular Momentum of the Dark Matter Halos of 
          MW and M31

     
Questions:

What are the  M31 and MW halo shapes: can we detect extension in any
direction?

Do we predictions any overdensities on the sky? Do we see a dark matter
overdensity in the opposite direction to the line of sight to M31? Is this
useful for indirect detection by Fermi? Satellite density as seen by LSST?

Can we measure the MW and M31 halo angular momentum? How does this compare
with the two stellar disks? What happens to the halo shape constraints if the
halo ang mtm is assumed to follow that of the disk?


Importance weighting:  
     
     -- Weight as above with M31 and M33 properties.

Paper III. The Past and Future History of the Local Group

     
Questions:

  Is M33 bound to M31? When did it arrive in the Local Group?

  All three galaxies' halos have been growing by merging and accretion of
  subhalos. How fast have they been growing? When did they accumulate most of
  their mass?

  When will M31 collide with the MW? Will M33 merge with M31, or with the
  pot-merger MW+M31 system?


Importance weighting:  
     
     -- Weight as above with M31 and M33 properties.

        
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analysis methods:

    -- Read in to python and compute any extra quantities, and
    -- weight by the likelihoods described above (eg distance to M31 etc)
