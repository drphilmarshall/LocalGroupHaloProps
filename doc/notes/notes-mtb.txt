Second (Current) Catalog:

Priors:
1.  The MW is a central galaxy.
2.  MW, M31, and M33 all have vmax > 80 km/s (driven in part by the simulation
     resolution)
3.  The ratio M_{rat} = M_{MW}/M{M31} >= 0.25
4.  Isolation requirement: the MW has exactly one object with 
     mass > 0.25M_{MW} with a distance r_{iso} < 2*744 = 1488kpc. This object
     is M31. 
5.  M33 is within 400 kpc from the center of M31

Algorithm:
1.  Cut the catalog at vmax = 80.
2.  Loop over centrals, treating each object as a candidate MW
3.  Identify MW-M31 pairs according to the criteria:
     -Count number of objects within r_{iso} bigger than 
      M_{rat}*M_{candidate MW}
     -Only keep systems that have exactly 1 such neighbor
4.  Loop over M33 candidates and identify all objects with vmax < 80 km/s 
     within 400 kpc
5.  Write out properties of all these objects

catalogs:
/nfs/slac/g/ki/ki04/mbusha/projects/LasDamas/Simulations/Consuelo/02/analysis/LG_project/lg_dat_file.txt
/nfs/slac/g/ki/ki04/mbusha/projects/LasDamas/Simulations/Consuelo/02/analysis/LG_project/M33_dat_file.txt

The first has the MW and M31 properties, the second has the M33 information.  Still need to calculate the inertial tensors of all objects.  


*************************************
First Catalog (now written over)

Prior selection description:
  
-Loop over central objects -> measure mass Mc
-Find closest central more massive than Mc, -> measure separation, r
-Isolation requirement: exclude pair if there is a second object (central or satellite) more massive than Mc closer than 2*r_MW
-Keep pair if r is within 5 sigma of 744 +/- 33

Properties to write out:
ID, Mass, positions, velocities, [angular momenta, intertial tenrosrs]

From Michael's Email:

There are 50 z=0 Consuelo snapshots that have been fully processed by Michael.
The catalogs are located:

/nfs/slac/g/ki/ki04/mbusha/projects/LasDamas/Simulations/Consuelo/LG_project

The files with names like `MW_halos_4001_z0p000_vir_bgc2.txt' are the
z = 0 catalogs, while the `MW_halos_4001_z0p054_vir_bgc2.txt' files
are the z = 0.054 ones.
