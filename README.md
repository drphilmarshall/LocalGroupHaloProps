LocalGroupHaloProps
===================

Inferring the mass etc of the local group galaxy halos (MW, M31 and M33)

### Getting started

Add the module to your `$PYTHONPATH` and your `$PATH`, and the scripts should
run. You'll need the Consuelo halo data of course - we'll try and upload a
small sample for test purposes?

You will also need the following library modules:

    import numpy,atpy,sys,getopt,string,subprocess,pyfits

and also `astropy`...
